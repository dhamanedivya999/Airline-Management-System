# Airline-Management-System
This project on Flight Management System is the automation of registration process of airline system. The system is able to provide much information like passenger’s details, flight details and the booking details. The system allows us to add records when a passenger reserves a ticket. It also allows to delete and update the records based on passenger’s requirements. For data storage and retrieval we use the MySQL database. It enables us to add any number of records in our database from the frontend which is Java core. Any changes made in the frontend will be reflected at the backend.
